## Image classification of COVID-19 X-rays using TensorFlow

This project was created to classify X-ray images given a combination of the Kaggle X-ray dataset and the COVID-19 Chest X-ray dataset collected by Dr. Joseph Paul Cohen of the Univeristy of Montreal. 

Two similar tasks were presented in this assignment. The first was to design and train a deep neural network to determine whether a given chest X-ray image was one of a healthy patient or of one with COVID-19. The second task required a deep neural network model be designed and trained to classify a chest X-ray into four different classes: normal, COVID-19, bacterial pneumonia, and viral pneumonia. Three different models were used for the second task classification in order to explore the validity of 
varying architectures.

The report of my findings, including t-SNE feature visualization graphs, are attached in this repository as a PDF.
